Hi 👋 My name is Ilia
=====================

Motivated and highly adaptable SAP Ariba Consultant with over 5 years of experience in implementing and supporting various SAP Ariba modules. Seeking to transition into a role as a Junior Frontend Developer to leverage my strong analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and passion for coding to contribute to innovative web development projects. I am currently enhancing my web development skills through a Front-End Developer course on Hexlet. During this course, so far, I have successfully completed three of four projects, which have provided me with valuable hands-on experience in frontend development.
